Version: 1.0.0-beta

## üíé About

Sumosear.ch is a database of escort service ads. SumoMaltego allows the researcher to fetch results from sumosear.ch using a phone number and perform Transforms on the results in Maltego. Given the potential for large results, this local Transform is best suited for Maltego Pro and Enterprise users being as the community edition severely limits the effectiveness of searching sumosear.ch with this method.
